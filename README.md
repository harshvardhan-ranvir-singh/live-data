Built an interactive web interface with dynamic filtering capabilities, premium percentage calculations, and color-coded risk indicators for both call and put options. Implemented session persistence, responsive design, and multi-table analysis allowing traders to simultaneously monitor up to three different stocks with customizable expiry dates. The system processes real-time option chain data for 183+ F&O stocks, calculating key metrics like premium percentages and strike price differentials to assist in options trading decisions.
