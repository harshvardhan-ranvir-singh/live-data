This is a Streamlit-based web application for real-time analysis of Indian stock options (F&O - Futures and Options).
A real-time options chain analysis dashboard using Python and Streamlit that provides live market data visualization for Indian F&O (Futures & Options) markets.

Built an interactive web interface with dynamic filtering capabilities, premium percentage calculations, and color-coded risk indicators for both call and put options. Implemented session persistence, responsive design, and multi-table analysis allowing traders to simultaneously monitor up to three different stocks with customizable expiry dates. The system processes real-time option chain data for 183+ F&O stocks, calculating key metrics like premium percentages and strike price differentials to assist in options trading decisions.
